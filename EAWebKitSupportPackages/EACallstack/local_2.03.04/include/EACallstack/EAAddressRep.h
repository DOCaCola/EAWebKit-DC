// EAAddressRep is the symbol lookup and caching engine of EACallstack.
// It allows for symbol lookups at runtime for a given platform and for
// cross-platform symbols lookups outside of a running application.
//
// The class users should be most concerned with here is AddressRepCache,
// as it is a high-level accessor to the rest of the EAAddressRep library.
// Normally you want to do all your operations through AddressRepCache,
// though you may be interested in doing uncached lookups through the
// AddressRepLookupSet class.
//
// A typical high level function you might want to use is this:
//
//     bool GetAddressRepFromAddress(uint64_t address, eastl::string8& sAddressRep)
//     {
//         const char* pStrResults[Callstack::kARTCount];
//         int         pIntResults[Callstack::kARTCount];
//
//         sAddressRep.clear();
//
//         const int outputFlags = gAddressRepCache.GetAddressRep(mAddressRepTypeFlags, address, pStrResults, pIntResults);
//
//         if(outputFlags & kARTFlagAddress)
//             sAddressRep.append_sprintf("%s\r\n", pStrResults[kARTSource]);
//
//         if(outputFlags & kARTFlagFileLine)
//             sAddressRep.append_sprintf("%s(%d)\r\n", pStrResults[kARTFileLine], pIntResults[kARTFileLine]);
//
//         if(outputFlags & kARTFlagFunctionOffset)
//             sAddressRep.append_sprintf("%s + %d\r\n", pStrResults[kARTFunctionOffset], pIntResults[kARTFunctionOffset]);
//
//         if(outputFlags & kARTFlagSource)
//             sAddressRep.append_sprintf("%s\r\n", pStrResults[kARTSource]);
//     }

		/// FilePath
		///
		/// The purpose of this class is to assist in constructing and deconstructing
		/// file paths in an easy and platform-independent way. It is common to want
		/// to take a file path and get just the directory from it. Another common 
		/// usage is to take a directory and file name and try appending different 
		/// extensions to the end of the file name.
		///
		/// This class implements path string and component construction and destruction
		/// and does not implement file, directory, and drive operations themselves.
		/// Please see the File and Directory IO modules for this functionality.
		/// Similarly, this class does not define constants such as kMaxPathLength
		/// and EA_FILE_PATH_SEPARATOR_8/16 as these constants are defined elsewhere 
		/// (in EAFileBase.h as of this writing).
		///
		/// This class allocates no memory at any time. It works on an internal buffer
		/// declared as a member of the class.
		///
		/// Instances of this class are not thread-safe. Use of an instance of this class 
		/// by multiple threads simultaneously must be protected by a synchronization 
		/// primitive such as a mutex.
		///
		/// Note that directory paths in this EAFile/EADirectory system are defined as 
		/// ending with a directory separator. This is done because it makes it simpler
		/// to work with directories and makes the specification of what a directory 
		/// path is be more concise.
		///
		/// See enum PathComponent in EAFileBase.h for definitions of each path component.
		///
		/// Note that this class includes the concept of a path 'drive'. This is a concept
		/// that is specific to some platform's paths. On operating systems that don't
		/// recognize the concept of drives (e.g. Unix), the drive component should 
		/// simply be left empty and not used. If you pass in a Unix path string and 
		/// ask FilePath what the drive is, you will get an empty string in return. 
		/// Under Windows, the drive consists of an alphabetic letter and a colon. 
		/// The alphabetic character is case-insensitive; "C:" and "c:" are equivalent.
		/// 
		/// Note: The FilePath class doesn't support the specification of paths via a
		/// "current working directory." If you want to supply a relative path to the 
		/// FilePath class, you need to call FullPath before passing the path to an
		/// instance of the FilePath class. This design is so in order to simplify the
		/// implementation of the FilePath class.

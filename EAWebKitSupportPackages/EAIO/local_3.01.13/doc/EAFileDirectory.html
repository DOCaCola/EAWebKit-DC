<h1>EAFileDirectory</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EAFileDirectory provides directory reading functionality. This is useful for both tools and runtime applications, particularly during development time in the case of runtime applications. With </p>
<p>Directory reading is implemented via two means: low level FindFirstEntry / FindNextEntry functions and a high level DirectoryIterator class.</p>
<pre class="code-example">EntryFindData* EntryFindFirst(const char16_t* pDirectory, const char16_t* pFilterPattern = NULL);
bool           EntryFindNext(EntryFindData* pData);
void           EntryFindFinish(EntryFindData* pData);
</pre>
<pre class="code-example">class DirectoryIterator
{
    bool Read(const char16_t* pDirectory, EntryList& entryList, 
               const char16_t* pFilterPattern, int nDirectoryEntryFlags);

    bool ReadRecursive(const char16_t* pBaseDirectory, EntryList& entryList, 
                        const char16_t* pFilterPattern, int nDirectoryEntryFlags, 
                        bool bIncludeBaseDirectory);
};</pre>
<p>Details for the above interfaces can be found below in the Interface section or in the EAFileDirectory.h file. See also <a href="EAFileBase.html">EAFileBase</a> for enumerations that are pertinent to EAFileDirectory. </p>
<h2>Example usage</h2>
<p>Low level functionality:</p>
<pre class="code-example">EntryFindData* p;


for(p = EntryFindFirst(L"/somedir/", L"*.html"); p; p = EntryFindNext(p))
    printf("%ls", p->mName);

EntryFindFinish(p);</pre>
<p>High level functionality: </p>
<pre class="code-example">DirectoryIterator dir;
EntryList         entryList;
 
dir.ReadRecursive(L"/somedir/", entryList,  L"*.html");

for(EntryList::iterator it(entryList.begin()), itEnd(entryList.end()); it != itEnd; ++it)
{
    const DirectoryIterator::Entry&amp; entry = *it;

    printf(&quot;%ls\n&quot;, entry.msName.c_str());
}</pre>

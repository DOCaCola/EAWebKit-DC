// This module implements an allocator specialized for objects of fixed size.
//
// The benefit is that there is no overhead for object storage and that many
// similar objects can be allocated near each other for good cache behaviour.
// Also, allocation is very fast. The downside to this kind of allocator is 
// that any unallocated space is not available for use; this is what we call 
// "external fragmentation."

		/// SmallObjectAllocator
		///
		/// Implements a memory heap tailored for small objects.
		///
		/// This class has no internally provided thread safety. Use of this 
		/// allocator by multiple threads currently must be manually coordinated.
		///
		/// Small object allocators typically provide optimizations in the way
		/// of speed and fragmentation reduction. However, there is a tradeoff
		/// between these two features whereby you can improve fragmentation
		/// behaviour further at the cost of some speed. SmallObjectAllocator
		/// is designed to improve fragmentation more than speed where there 
		/// happens to be such a tradeoff. 
		///
		/// This class does not implement allocation of memory beyond the max
		/// small object size. It does not forward Malloc calls to any other
		/// allocator in the case that it cannot allocate the size you request.
		/// In these cases you need to wrap SmallObjectAllocator and implement
		/// the error handling/allocation forwarding yourself. The reason for 
		/// this is that SmallObjectAllocator couldn't provide any better 
		/// handling than you could yourself, whereas you get more flexibility
		/// if you handle it yourself.
		///
		/// This allocator is quite fast. However, if you want the absolute fastest
		/// allocator, you may want to use your own hand-tailored small block 
		/// allocator or use PPMalloc StackAllocator. SmallBlockAllocator favors
		/// reduction of fragmentation above absolute maximization of speed. 
		/// It also implements a reasonable compromise for genericity and speed,
		/// whereas a hand-tailored implementation can be hard-coded directly 
		/// for your own circumstances. You may find it best to start with 
		/// SmallObjectAllocator and once you see how your application works,
		/// you can write your own, make a modified branch of SmallObjectAllocator,
		/// or just stick with SmallObjectAllocator.
		///
		/// Example usage:
		///     SmallObjectAllocator soa;
		///     soa.Init();
		///     soa.SetCoreAllocationFunction(pSomeAllocationFunction, pSomeFreeFunction, pSomeContext);
		///     void* p = soa.Malloc(17); 
		///     soa.Free(p);
		///     soa.Shutdown();

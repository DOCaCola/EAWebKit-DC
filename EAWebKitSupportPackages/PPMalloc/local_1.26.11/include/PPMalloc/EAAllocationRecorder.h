		///
		/// Records and plays back allocations. If PPM_ENABLED is enbabled, then the
		/// GeneralAllocator (a.k.a. PPMalloc) is used for playback. Otherwise, the 
		/// built-in new[] and delete[] (not malloc/free) are used. new/delete is 
		/// used because the C++ language lets you override these but not malloc/free.
		///
		/// In recording mode, the recorder writes allocations to a disk file. If you 
		/// want to record on a platform that doesn't let you write to disk files or 
		/// isn't likely to have enough space for recorded disk files, you can use
		/// this class to format a record line for you and you can write that line 
		/// elsewhere as needed.
		///
		/// The format of recording files is text. Binary formats have been studied
		/// and compared to text formats (http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/chilimbi00designing.html)
		/// but binary formats tend to be only ~30% more efficient in uncompressed 
		/// space and ~10% more efficient in compressed format and are much harder 
		/// to read. The format is implemented with one allocation event per text 
		/// line and each event simply echos the parameters and return value of 
		/// the call. The format is this:
		///     command [result] arg1 arg2 ... [flags]
		/// Pointers and flags are in hex; sizes are in decimal. Hex values have no leading '0x'.
		/// 
		/// As an example, we have the following lines (which don't use the optional final flags argument):
		///    m c23a17bc 20\n                  // Malloc 20 bytes. Return value was 0xc23a17bc.
		///    a c23a17bc 20 16\n               // Malloc 20 bytes, with 16 byte alignment. Return value was 0xc23a17bc.
		///    o c23a17bc 20 16 8\n             // Malloc 20 bytes, with 16 byte allignment and 8 byte alignment offset.
		///    r c23a17bc 18cb34a2 28\n         // Realloc pointer 0x18cb34a2 to 28 bytes. Return value was 0xc23a17bc.
		///    c c23a17bc 15 2\n                // Calloc 15 elements of 2 bytes each (i.e. 30 bytes). Return value was 0xc23a17bc.
		///    f c23a17bc\n                     // Free pointer 0xc23a17bc.
		///    ; arbitrary comment text         // This is a comment line, which is to be ignored during playback of recordings.
		///                                     // This is an empty line, which is to be ignored during playback of recordings.
		///    m c23a17bc 20\n                  // Malloc 20 bytes. Return value was 0xc23a17bc.
		///
		/// In the case of the flags argument, the above malloc line might be:
		///    m c23a17bc 20 e2\n               // Malloc 20 bytes with allocation flags 0xe2. Return value was 0xc23a17bc.

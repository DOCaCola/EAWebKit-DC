<h1>Class Documentation</h1>
<p>This page is set to redirect you to the <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">PPMalloc doxygen documentation</a>.
  If you are not taken then there you can manually click the link here
  yourself. If the link doesn't work, then it's likely that the doxygen
  documentation hasn't been generated for this package distribution.
  Perhaps this distribution is curtailed in order to preserve space. To
  generate it, simply run doxygen.exe on the ppmalloc.doxygen.config file
  in the doxygen directory.<br>

// This class will make sure that the memory returned will be aligned by
// 'align' bytes, and additionally ensure the result is not aligned on the next
// largest power of 2.
//
// IMPORTANT: Please note that this allocator will allocate memory with less
// alignment than many systems expect (because in general an ICoreAllocator
// implementation should return memory aligned to at least
// EA_PLATFORM_MIN_MALLOC_ALIGNMENT).  So, this example is only really useful
// for testing situations or in situations where a user/library of the
// ICoreAllocator instance has ensured it can actually work properly when
// alignment is possibly less than EA_PLATFORM_MIN_MALLOC_ALIGNMENT.
//
// Minimally aligning memory allocations is useful for testing purposes.
// Sometimes a user of the allocator may request alignment less than the actual
// memory required.  But since, in general, an allocator can return a block
// that is more aligned that the requested amount, it can hide the problem.
//
// Example: if you request an allocation that is aligned to 4 bytes, then the
// result will be aligned to 4 bytes.  However the allocator will additionally
// make sure that the allocation is not aligned on 8 bytes.

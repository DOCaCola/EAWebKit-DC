// Implements a portable allocator for memory on the C++ stack. Similar to 
// alloca but portable and with no limits on allocation size. However, 
// the alloca function is more efficient and thus is superior in cases

	  /// class LocalArrayAllocator
	  ///
	  /// Brief
	  /// Allocates an array of objects quickly for cases when you don't know the size
	  /// of the array beforehand. This is similar to the alloca function but has no
	  /// limit on the maximum amount of memory allocated.
	  ///
	  /// Detail
	  /// This templated class allows you to allocate a dynamically sized temporary
	  /// block of memory local to a function in a way that causes it to use some
	  /// stack space instead of using the (very slow) malloc function. You don't
	  /// want to call malloc/new to allocate temporary blocks of memory when speed
	  /// is important. This class is only practical if you are allocating arrays of
	  /// objects (especially smaller objects). If you have a class whose size is
	  /// 40K, you aren't going to be able to put even one of them on the stack.
	  /// If you don't need an array but instead just need a single object, then you
	  /// can simply create your object on the stack and be done with it. However,
	  /// there are some times when you need a temporary array of objects (or just
	  /// an array of chars or pointers) but don't know the size beforehand. That's
	  /// where this class is useful.
	  ///
	  /// Notes
	  /// An alternative implementation would use macros and the nonportable but 
	  /// often found 'alloca' function. You can't use alloca with a template like
	  /// below because unless the template was guaranteed to be inline the memory
	  /// would become 'freed' before the allocation function returned.
	  ///
	  /// Parameters:
	  ///    The class takes three templated parameters: T, nStackCount, bConstruct.
	  ///      T           -- The type of object being allocated. Examples include char,
	  ///                     std::string, int*, Point3D*.
	  ///      nStackCount -- How many items to allocate on the stack before switching
	  ///                     to a heap allocation. Note that if you want to write
	  ///                     portable code, you need to use no more than about 2K
	  ///                     of stack space. So make sure nStackCount*sizeof(T) < 2048.
	  ///      bConstruct  -- This is normally 1, but setting it to 0 is a hint to the
	  ///                     compiler that you are constructing a type that has no
	  ///                     constructor. Testing showed that the VC++ compiler wasn't
	  ///                     completely able to optimize on its own. In particular, it
	  ///                     was smart enough to remove the while loop, but not smart
	  ///                     enough to remore the pTArrayEnd assignment.
	  ///
	  /// Benchmarks:
	  ///    Testing one one machine showed that allocating and freeing a block of
	  ///    2048 bytes via malloc/free took 8700 and 8400 clock ticks respectively.
	  ///    Using this stack allocator to do the same thing took 450 and 375 clock
	  ///    ticks respectively.
	  ///
	  /// Usage and examples:
	  ///    Since we are using a local allocator and not overloading global or class
	  ///    operator new, you have to directly call LocalArrayAllocator::New instead
	  ///    of operator new. So instead of saying:
	  ///       SomeStruct* pStructArray = new SomeStruct[13];
	  ///    you say:
	  ///       SomeStruct* pStructArray = stackAllocator.New(13);
	  ///
	  ///    void Example(int nSize){
	  ///       LocalArrayAllocator<char, 512> stackAllocator;           // Create an instance
	  ///       char* pArray = LocalArrayAllocator.New(nSize);           // Allocate memory, it will auto-freed.
	  ///       memset(pArray, 0, nSize*sizeof(char));                   // Do something with the memory.
	  ///    }
	  ///
	  ///    void Example(int nSize){
	  ///       LocalArrayAllocator<int*, 512, 0> LocalArrayAllocator;   // Create an instance. We use the 'construct' hint feature here.
	  ///       int** pArray = LocalArrayAllocator.New(nSize);           // Allocate memory.
	  ///       memset(pArray, 0, nSize*sizeof(int*));                   // Do something with the memory.
	  ///       LocalArrayAllocator.Delete(pArray);                      // In this example, we explicity free the memory.
	  ///    }

<h1>Graphics Engine Support </h1>
<p>This document discusses how to get EAText to work with an arbitrary graphics engine. You should expect it to take about one or two days' work to make an EAText adapter for your graphics system, assuming you are familiar with your graphics system. You should be familiar with the information in the 
<a href="User%20Guide.html">User Guide</a> document before reading this document.</p>
<p>Text must be drawn by some graphics system, but there are different graphics systems across varying applications and platforms. EAText attempts to implement as much text/font/glyph/layout as posible, but there still needs to be some glue provided by the user to make this work with a given graphics system. There are two fundamental things the user needs to provide in the way of this glue:</p>
<UL __designer:dtid="562949953421739">
  <LI __designer:dtid="562949953421740">A subclass of EAText GlyphCache which implements four functions. </LI>
  <LI 
__designer:dtid="562949953421741">A glyph mesh container which understands the graphic system's vertex/index buffer API. </LI>
</UL>
<h3>Glyph Cache</h3>
<p>The GlyphCache class implements a dynamic texture atlas, which consists of one or more textures which store glyphs derived from outline (e.g. TrueType) fonts. Recall that TrueType fonts are defined by scalable outlines but we need to draw them on the screen as bitmaps. The conversion of a TrueType character from its outline form on disk to a bitmap form in memory is a fairly CPU-intensive task. So what we do is implement a cache of these bitmaps which stores them in one or more textures. Here is an example of a glyph cache texture completely filled with glyphs. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="images/GlyphCacheTexture.jpg" width="258" height="258"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GlyphCache class implements the management of this dynamic texture atla for you. However, since it uses a graphics system texture to store the bitmapped glyphs, it cannot do so without some help from the user. Below is the public interface for the current version of the GlyphCache class. Note that the four functions in blue are pure-virtual and the user must provide an implementation of this in a subclass of GlyphCache. The user can additionally override other functions in the GlyphCache class or entirely re-implement the GlyphCache class. </p>

<h3>Glyph Mesh </h3>
<p>A glyph mesh is a vertex buffer of glyphs with their associated texture and color information. It is much like a text &quot;model.&quot; Just as you might implement an object in your 3D world as a 3D model, a block of layed out text is best implemented as a model as well. That way text can be drawn repeatedly quickly and with lighting, transforms, and GPU programs (shaders)  like any other model. The easiest way to accomplish this with EAText is to implement a GlyphMesh adapter class. Such a class converts the  LineLayout generated by Typesetter into one of these glyph meshes. We will refer to the GlyphMesh class provided by the EATextRNA package as an example for the rest of this section.</p><p>Here is the current GlyphMesh public interface from the EATextRNA package:</p><pre class="code-example">class GlyphMesh_RNA

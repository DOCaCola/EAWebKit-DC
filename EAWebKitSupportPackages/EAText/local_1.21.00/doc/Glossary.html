		text. In particular, it is used to store information regarding the 
		bidirectional embedding levels of a run of text. A first step in the 
		text layout pipeline is to take a paragraph and identify runs of like 
		directionality and embedding level. An analysis stores this information. <br>

    <tr>
      <td style="width: 150px; vertical-align: top;">Complex script<br>
      </td>
      <td>A complex script has at least one of the following attributes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Bidirectional character ordering</li>
        <li>Contextual shaping</li>
        <li>Combining characters</li>
        <li>Specialized word-breaking and justification rules</li>
        <li>Illegal character combinations</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
		Bidirectional rendering refers to the script's ability to handle text 
		that reads both left-to-right and right-to-left. For example, in the 
		bidirectional rendering of Arabic, the default reading direction for 
		text is right-to-left, but for some numbers it is left-to-right. 
		Processing a complex script must account for the difference between the 
		logical (keystroke) order and the displayed order of the glyphs on the 
		screen.<br>
      <br>
		Additionally, processing must properly deal with caret movement and 
		cursor hit testing. The mapping between screen position and a character 
		index requires knowledge of font metrics and the layout algorithm.<br>
      <br>
		Contextual shaping occurs when a script's characters change shape 
		depending on the characters that surround them. This occurs in English 
		cursive writing (&quot;handwriting&quot;) when a lowercase &quot;l&quot; changes shape 
		depending on the character that precedes it such as an &quot;a&quot; (connects low 
		to the &quot;l&quot;) or an &quot;o&quot; (connects high). Arabic is a script that exhibits 
		contextual shaping.<br>
      <br>
		Combining characters (ligatures) are characters that join into one 
		character when placed together. One example is the &quot;ae&quot; combination in 
		English; it is sometimes represented by a single character. <br>
		Arabic is a script that has many combining characters.<br>
      <br>
		Specialized word break and justification refers to scripts that have 
		complex rules for dividing words between lines or justifying text on a 
		line. Thai is such a script.<br>
      <br>
		Filtering out invalid character combinations occurs when a language does 
		not allow certain character combinations. Thai is such a script.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Coverage<br>
      </td>
      <td>Coverage refers to the support a font has for the gamut of characters. 
		While a font can have glyphs for any Unicode code point, it is common 
		that fonts support only certain scripts. Basic fonts have coverage for 
		only Latin scripts, whereas a Chinese font will usually have support for 
		(or coverage of) Chinese script and basic Latin script. <br>

      <td>Decomposition<br>
      </td>
      <td>Decomposition is the process of breaking a composed or shaped 
		character down into its basic parts, often for the purpose of doing 
		proper searching and comparison. For example, if you search for the 
		digit 1 in a paragraph of text and there is a 1 which is in superscript 
		form, it should be found. Similarly, a superscript 1 should compare as 
		equal to a regular 1 in terms of sorting. Other kinds of composition 
		exist as well, such as the application of diacriticals to base 
		characters.<br>

      </td>

		such glyphs are usually at the baseline or below it.<br>

      <td>Embedding refers to the inclusion
of a run of opposing direction text within a
run of text. If you have an English sentence and put some RTL text in
the middle of it, the RTL text is embedded within the primary LTR text.
If you then embed a run of LTR text within the RTL text then you have
an
additional level of embedding in place. An embedding level of 0 means
LTR, a
level of 1 means RTL alone or within LTR 0, a level of 2 means LTR
within RTL
1, a level of 3 means RTL within LTF of level 2, etc.<br>

gasp</td>
<td>
gasp (Grid-fitting and Scan-conversion Procedure) refers to information stored in
a TrueType font which identifies which font sizes are best for applying hinting
and anti-aliasing. A very large font (&gt;= 64 pixels) generally doesn't need to
have hinting applied. On the other hand, a small font (~10 pixels) almost always
needs hinting in order to look good. TrueType fonts often have a gasp table, which
simply says what sizes the font author thinks should have hinting and anti-aliasing
applied. The gasp information itself provides no hinting or anti-aliasing functionality.</td>

      <td style="width: 150px; vertical-align: top;">Glyph</td>
      <td>A glyph is a graphical
representation of a character. In terms of computer text processing and
display, a glyph may be a combination of multiple code points, as would
be the case with separate accents or other
diacriticals. There is a distinction between glyphs and characters that
is subtle but significant. Character are what the user types on their
keyboard, whereas glyphs are the physical manifestation of such
characters. The ratio between characters and glyphs is not necessarily
1:1, though it is often so for simple English text.<br>

there is no adjustment and the glyphs are regularly drawn; a negative
value means the glyphs are made closer together than normal, and a
positive value means the glyphs are farther apart than normal. <br>

        <p>Some letters in some languages are compound letters. For example, in Unicode, character U+01F3 is LATIN SMALL LETTER DZ; it is a single Unicode character, but it looks like two characters. Much like with regular characters, it looks like dz when in lower case, looks like Dz when it begins a capitalized word, and looks like DZ when it is upper case or in an all-caps word. But since this is a single Unicode character, it needs to be represented with three Unicode code points and not two. These three points are called the lower case, title case, and upper case versions of the character. For characters like this, the title case version of it (Dz) is not the same as the upper case version of it (DZ). <BR>

# RemoveGlyphs
#
# FontLab Python script to remove unneeded glyphs.
# by Paul Pedriana
#
# This script must be run from within FontLab.
# This script should be placed in the FontLab/Macros/<DirNameOfYourChoice> directory.
#
# This script removes all glyphs from a font based on a list of Unicode
# characters to retain. It is useful for taking some large font and
# paring it down to a minimum required set of supported characters.
# This allows for saving disk space and runtime memory. This is useful
# only if you know that you will need just the characters you are
# retaining in the font, as might be the case with applications that
# use a fixed number of characters known ahead of time.
# This script isn't smart enough to understand OpenType tables that may
# be present in the font and thus this script may remove more glyphs
# than intended for some fonts, in particular fonts with Arabic, Thai,
# and similar complex OpenType information.
#
# Currently it expects a file called C:\temp\KeepListUnicode.txt
# which has one line per Unicode character to retain, like so:
#   0x0020
#   0x0021
#   0x0022
# The list doesn't need to be sorted, doesn't need to use hex numbering,
# and it doesn't need to be unique.
